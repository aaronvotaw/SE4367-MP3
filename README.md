I uploaded all of the java files from the project. My MethodAdapter.java file should instrument HelloThread - HelloThread2 correctly, although the added instrumentation from part 2 will still show up when instrumenting the older files. I also commented out the "transforming" print statements from part 0 to avoid cluttering the output up.
